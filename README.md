Lab#0
Warming Up

Task 0: Chose two languages, at least one of these to be Object Oriented (OO). Research and demonstrate in examples (code) how we can use (or simulate if there is no such possibility) core OOP concepts - inheritance, polymorphism, incapsulation. 

Task 1: Make a free form comparison/analysis of these concepts in your two languages. For example you can use a grid with pros and cons. Max one A4 page. Push your report to public repo and submit link to it.
